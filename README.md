* *Responsible Autonomy*
* *People are the most important asset*
* *Never hire for growth/hiring targets; only hire for fit*

#### Leadership

* Leadership is not appointed/given, it is earned
  * You are a leader if and only if people follow you.

* *Only hire people you can trust*
  * Policies/procedures are created when you can't trust your employees — i.e. you made bad hires.
