Culture

Ethos
-----

### General

* *Make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do.*
* *Solve problems by fixing the environment that allowed them to occur.*
* *Automate all the things!*
* The worst thing we can do for happiness and productivity is disturb the culture. 
  The worst thing we can do to the culture, is introduce tension.
* *Transparency & Communication*
* *Collaboration*

### People

* *Happiness is productivity is happiness* — at least for people who care about what they do
* *Responsible Autonomy*
* *People are the most important asset*
* *Never hire for growth/hiring targets; only hire for fit*
* *High cohesion, low coupling* — ([Highly aligned, loosly coupled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3e1lnixKBM#t=136s))

#### Leadership

* Leadership is not appointed/given, it is earned
  * You are a leader if and only if people follow you.
* leads/managers are not bosses
  * they are advocates
  * they are 3 steps ahead of team clearing obstacles
  * they inspire, not dictate
  * managers of people, not managers of process

#### Hiring

* *Hire for culture fit first, talent second*
* *Only hire people you can trust*
  * Policies/procedures are created when you can't trust your employees — i.e. you made bad hires.

#### Compensation

* Pay them as much as you would pay them to keep them from leaving for a higher-paying job
